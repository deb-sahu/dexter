## 🌟 My Philosophy

### Why Open Source?

Dexter is open source because:
- **Transparency**: Users can verify security and privacy claims
- **Learning**: Developers can learn from real-world Flutter code
- **Collaboration**: The community can help improve the app
- **Trust**: Open code builds trust with users

### Why These Restrictions?

These guidelines exist to:
- Protect the integrity of the Dexter brand
- Prevent user confusion from unauthorized copies
- Ensure proper security and privacy standards
- Maintain a healthy, collaborative community

**I want contributors, not clones.**
